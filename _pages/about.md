I am a data scientist, and I have recently completed my MS in Computer Science from Dartmouth College. I was a graduate researcher in the [Augmented Health Lab](https://www.ah-lab.cs.dartmouth.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. Temiloluwa Prioleau](https://www.t-prioleau.com/). In my research, I used passive sensing data, as well as clinical biomarkers, to identify patterns in diabetes management. My research interest is in using data science and machine learning to understand and model human behaviors, and ultimately support data-driven decision making.


I am on the job market--- please reach out if you have any advice or know of any opportunities. I am available for full-time positions and freelance projects.
